30-Day Plan (short daily tasks)

Each day: short reading + one hands-on action + a one-line reflection.

Week 1 — Foundations

Day 01 — OSI model: Map common protocols to OSI layers.

Day 02 — Binary & Bits: Practice decimal↔binary (0–255).

Day 03 — IPv4 basics: Dotted decimal and octets. Show your machine IP and convert an octet to binary.

Day 04 — Subnetting intro: CIDR notation and /24 meaning. Split a /24 into /26 ranges.

Day 05 — Subnetting practice: Solve 5 subnetting problems.

Day 06 — IPv6 intro: Key differences and rationale.

Day 07 — Recap & cheatsheet: Consolidate notes.

Week 2 — Core protocols & tools

Day 08 — TCP vs UDP: Learn TCP 3-way handshake. Capture traffic with ss or tcpdump.

Day 09 — DNS fundamentals: A, CNAME, TXT, MX. Use dig/nslookup.

Day 10 — HTTP/HTTPS basics: Requests, responses, and status codes.

Day 11 — Ports & Services: Common ports (22,80,443,3306). Use ss -tulpn.

Day 12 — NAT & PAT: Home router NAT concepts.

Day 13 — Routing basics: Default gateway and static routes.

Day 14 — Troubleshooting toolkit: ping, traceroute, curl, dig, ss, tcpdump.

Week 3 — Cloud networking (AWS-focused)

Day 15 — VPC fundamentals: CIDR blocks, public vs private subnets, IGW.

Day 16 — Security Groups vs NACLs: Statefulness and rule order.

Day 17 — Route tables & NAT Gateway: Private subnet internet access patterns.

Day 18 — Elastic IPs & Bastion hosts: Secure access to private instances.

Day 19 — Load balancers (ALB/NLB): L4 vs L7 differences.

Day 20 — S3 & VPC endpoints: When to use endpoints.

Day 21 — Lab: Create a small VPC with 2 subnets and an EC2 instance (Terraform optional).

Week 4 — Containers, Kubernetes & observability

Day 22 — Docker networking: bridge, host, overlay networks.

Day 23 — Kubernetes networking basics: Pod IPs, Services (ClusterIP, NodePort).

Day 24 — Ingress controllers: How Ingress routes external traffic.

Day 25 — CNI & network policies: Restricting pod communication.

Day 26 — Service mesh intro: Purpose of Istio/Linkerd.

Day 27 — Network observability: Metrics to monitor (latency, packet loss) and tools.

Day 28 — Security & best practices: Encryption in transit, least privilege.

Week 5 — Wrap up

Day 29 — Scenario troubleshooting: Simulate and document an incident (e.g., pod cannot reach DB).

Day 30 — Project & reflection: Deploy a simple app across subnet boundaries, document steps and postmortem.
