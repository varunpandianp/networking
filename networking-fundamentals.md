# OSI Model (7 Layers â€“ Think "All People Seem To Need Data Processing")

Physical Layer â€“ Cables, switches, signals, bits (0/1).

Data Link Layer â€“ MAC address, Ethernet, ARP.

Network Layer â€“ IP addresses, routing, ICMP.

Transport Layer â€“ TCP/UDP, port numbers, reliability.

Session Layer â€“ Manages sessions, authentication, check-pointing.

Presentation Layer â€“ Data formatting, encryption, compression.

Application Layer â€“ End-user services (HTTP, FTP, DNS, SSH).

ðŸ‘‰ TCP/IP model (practical use) is simplified into 4 layers:

Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access.

# IP, Subnet, Gateway

IP Address â€“ Unique address of a device on a network (e.g., 192.168.1.10).

Subnet Mask â€“ Defines the range of IPs inside the network (e.g., 255.255.255.0 means 256 IPs in the network, 254 usable).

Default Gateway â€“ Router IP used to communicate outside your network (e.g., if your PC is 192.168.1.10, gateway may be 192.168.1.1).

Example:

PC IP: 192.168.1.10
Subnet: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1


This means â†’ PC can talk to others in 192.168.1.x directly, but for internet/outside networks, it sends packets to 192.168.1.1.

# Public vs Private IP

Private IP â€“ Used inside home/office networks. Not routable on internet.

IPv4 ranges:

10.0.0.0 â€“ 10.255.255.255

172.16.0.0 â€“ 172.31.255.255

192.168.0.0 â€“ 192.168.255.255

Public IP â€“ Assigned by ISP, unique on internet (e.g., 103.25.200.55).

ðŸ‘‰ Private IP â†’ NAT â†’ Public IP â†’ Internet.

# DNS Basics

DNS = Domain Name System â€“ Converts domain names â†’ IP addresses.

Example: www.google.com â†’ 142.250.182.14.

Types of DNS Records:

A record â†’ Domain to IPv4

AAAA record â†’ Domain to IPv6

CNAME â†’ Alias name

MX â†’ Mail server

Works in hierarchy:

Local DNS cache

ISP DNS server

Root â†’ TLD (.com, .org) â†’ Authoritative server

# Ports & Services

Port = Logical door on a device for communication.

Range: 0 â€“ 65535

Well-known ports (0â€“1023): Common services

Registered ports (1024â€“49151): Software vendors

Dynamic ports (49152â€“65535): Temporary sessions

# Common ports:

22 â†’ SSH

80 â†’ HTTP

443 â†’ HTTPS

53 â†’ DNS

25 â†’ SMTP (mail)

3306 â†’ MySQL

5432 â†’ PostgreSQL

6379 â†’ Redis
